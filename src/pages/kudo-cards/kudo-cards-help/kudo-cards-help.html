      The recognition of valued work, not financial incentives encourage
      <strong>intrinsic motivation</strong>within an organization.
  </p>
  <p>
      “Money is only advised as a reward when you need to motivate people to do an uninteresting or repetitive job,” wrote Jurgen Appelo. But there’s no doubt that recognition is essential to feeling like your work is valued in an organization.
      That’s why Kudos are a growing trend around the world, as a way to facilitate thanks and acknowledgement.

  <strong>What are Kudo Cards?
    </strong>
    <p>
        Some companies call them HERO awards, others Rippas or Hugs, we call them Kudos. It is a written and public recognition of a colleague for something she has contributed to the team. A Kudo is not just given from the top down, but peer-to-peer and bottom-up. Across departments and organizations, anyone can recognize someone else’s work. It’s a way to break down hierarchical limitations and to encourage everyone to offer instant positive feedback.
